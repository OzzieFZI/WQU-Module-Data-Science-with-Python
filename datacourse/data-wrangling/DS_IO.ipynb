    "The `read_csv` method is very flexible to deal with the formatting of different data sets. Some data sets will include column headers while others may not. Some data sets will include an index while others may not. Some data sets may have values separated by tabs, semicolons, or other characters instead of commas. There are options in the `read_csv` method for dealing with all of these. You can read about them in the [Pandas documentation on `read_csv`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html). We'll also discuss it further in the [Pandas notebook](DS_Pandas.ipynb)."
